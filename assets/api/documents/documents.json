        "Abstract":"The aphorism, As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,\" not only embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have appeared without them. This applies equally to those acts called \"spontaneous\" and \"unpremeditated\" as to those which are deliberately executed. Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry.",

        "Abstract":"THIS BOOK is concerned with the art of realising your desire. It gives you an account of the mechanism used in production of the visible world. It is a small book but not slight. There is a treasure in it, a clearly defined road to the realization of your dreams. Were it possible to carry convitction to another by means of reasoned arguments and detailed instances, this book would be many times its size. It is seldom possible, however, to do so by means of written statements or arguments since to the suspended judgement it always seems plausible to say that author was dishonest or deluded, and therefore, his evidence was tainted. \n Consequently, I have purposely omitted all arguments and testimonials, and simply challenge the open-minded reader to practice the law of consciousness as revealed in this book. Personal success will prove far more convincing tha all the books that could be written on the subject \n ~ NEVILLE",
